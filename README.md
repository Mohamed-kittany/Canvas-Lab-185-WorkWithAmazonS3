# Working with Amazon S3

## Lab Overview

In this project, I created and configured an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to share images with an external user from a media company, mediacouser, who was hired to provide pictures of the caf√©'s products. The S3 bucket was also configured to automatically send an email notification to the administrator whenever the bucket contents were modified.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, I accomplished the following:

- Used the s3api and s3 AWS CLI commands to create and configure an S3 bucket.
- Verified write permissions for a user on an S3 bucket.
- Configured event notifications on an S3 bucket.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Creating and Configuring an S3 Bucket

- **Created S3 Bucket**:
  - Utilized the AWS CLI `s3api` and `s3` commands to create a new S3 bucket for storing product images.

- **Configured Bucket Permissions**:
  - Set appropriate bucket policies and permissions to allow the IAM user mediacouser to add, change, or delete images from the bucket.
  - Reviewed and verified Amazon S3 permissions to ensure secure and appropriate access for each role.

### 2. Verifying Write Permissions

- **Verified User Permissions**:
  - Confirmed that the IAM user mediacouser had the necessary permissions to upload, modify, and delete objects in the S3 bucket.
  - Tested access by signing in as mediacouser and performing various actions on the bucket contents via the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI.

### 3. Configuring Event Notifications

- **Set Up SNS Topic**:
  - Created an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic named s3NotificationTopic for sending email notifications.
  
- **Configured S3 Event Notifications**:
  - Configured the S3 bucket to send notifications to the SNS topic whenever changes were detected in the bucket contents.
  
- **Subscription to SNS Topic**:
  - Subscribed the administrator's email address to the s3NotificationTopic SNS topic to receive email notifications of any changes to the bucket contents.

### Usage Flow

1. **External User Uploads/Modifies Images**:
   - The external user (mediacouser) signs in to the AWS Management Console or uses AWS CLI to upload, change, or delete images in the S3 bucket.
   
2. **Event Detection and Notification**:
   - When changes are detected in the S3 bucket, Amazon S3 triggers an event notification.
   - The event notification is sent to the s3NotificationTopic SNS topic.
   - The administrator receives an email with the details of the changes made to the bucket contents.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in configuring Amazon S3 for secure file sharing, managing user permissions, and setting up automated notifications for bucket events. By completing these tasks, I demonstrated my ability to effectively manage and monitor data within an AWS S3 environment.
